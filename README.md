# About the Creator
Henlo! I'm alex "DrKeck" keckely. I created this app to flex my skills in creating a full stack application using some of the trending technologies to be able to better understand the workflow and code of front to back applications.

I am a recent graduate of the UC Berkley coding boot camp who is attempting to apply himself into web development roles.
